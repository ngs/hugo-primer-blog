Welcome to my new blog! This site is built with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and styled with [Primer CSS](https://primer.style/), GitHub's design system.

## Features

This theme includes:

- **Dark mode support** - Automatically syncs with your system preferences, or you can choose manually
- **Multilingual** - Full i18n support for multiple languages
- **Responsive design** - Looks great on all devices
- **Primer CSS** - Clean, modern design using GitHub's design system

## Code Example

Here's a simple Go code example:

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    fmt.Println("Hello, World!")
}
```

## Markdown Support

This theme supports all standard Markdown features:

- **Bold text** and *italic text*
- [Links](https://example.com)
- Lists (like this one!)
